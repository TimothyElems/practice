# practice
_makes permanent_

This is a public repo to maintain accountability! 
I am logging my daily practice session. These sessions come immediately after my typing practices ([Monkey Type](#) and [Keys BR](#)).  
The programs come from [an app](), for practicing Python. I will execute each program in Python and whatever other language I aim to learn. And when I pick up a new language, I will return to this repo and start from the top!
